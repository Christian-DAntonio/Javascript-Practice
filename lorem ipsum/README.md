9:03 AM - I'm back! I had another busy week last week, but know that my trip to Italy is approaching, I can finally rid myself of my usual job searching duties and focus more on coding! I'm hoping to get this project and another one done before I go to Italy.
9:08 AM - The generate button was offically added to the website using simple HTML code and classes. The next step would be to add the code that generates the lorem ispsum text when pushed.
9:21 AM - app.js file updated. I put in all of those paragraphs through the usage if a const function and I called all of the tags in the html file using the const functions and then slecting them with the document.querySelector and document.getElementById functions.
9:35 AM - Added some more functionality to the app.js file. I added an eventListener form that would count the amount of times the user would click on the button when opening up the console. The next step for this would be to add functioanlity to the button where it would show one of the paragraphs when clicked.
