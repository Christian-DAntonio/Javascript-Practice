9:31 AM - Today is the day for a new JavaScript project!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This time I decided to do the lorem ipsum generator project, because thats what caught my attention the most.
July 29th 2024 9:03 AM - I'm back! I had another busy week last week, but know that my trip to Italy is approaching, I can finally rid myself of my usual job searching duties and focus more on coding! I'm hoping to get this project and another one done before I go to Italy. 
9:08 AM - The generate button was offically added to the website using simple HTML code and classes. The next step would be to add the code that generates the lorem ispsum text when pushed.
9:21 AM - app.js file updated. I put in all of those paragraphs through the usage if a const function and I called all of the tags in the html file using the const functions and then slecting them with the document.querySelector and document.getElementById functions. 
9:35 AM - Added some more functionality to the app.js file. I added an eventListener form that would count the amount of times the user would click on the button when opening up the console. The next step for this would be to add functioanlity to the button where it would show one of the paragraphs when clicked. 
July 30th 2024 8:48 AM - Back for more coding! I can't do that much, because I have a hair appointment at 11:30, and I still want to work on my HelpUsDefend task a bit, but I will do the most that I can today. 
9:08 AM - The Generate button officaly produces a random assortment of pararaphs when the button is pressed now!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was done via the use of some more simple JavaScript coding and some if statements. 
9:30 AM - I modified the generate buttons functionality and add an else statement so that it would generate random sentences whenever it is pressed.

9:05 AM - I'm back again! I'm hoping that by today, I'm going to complete this project.
9:37 AM - Updated the functionalit of the generate button. This time when you enter 9 or higher into the input bar, it will give you exactly nine pararaphs. 
9:44 AM - I have offically completed this project.
