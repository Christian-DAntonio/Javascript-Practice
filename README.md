I was too busy yesterday too work on this project, but now I have time! I'm hoping that I can get this one done by today and move onto the next one.
8:41 AM
I got the CSS implemented into the navbar. This changed the design of the navbar and changed the fonts of the actual navbar elemenst as well. Still no 
hamburger menu and somthngs may need to be tweeked. Also add some more Javascript in the app.js file.
8:45 PM
The logo's size got fixed. I simply got rid of the style that was in the img src for the logo.
9:23 PM
Figured out a way to put in a burger menu in my application. I forgot a piece of code that would insert the burger menu into my application whenever my navbars
screen size changed. It also insert the logo links to different social media. I'm basically all done with this project.
