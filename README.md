10:40 AM - I haven't done JavaScript coding in a while. All the new projects, interviews, job searching and general business of these updcoming weeks overshadowed this. But now I'm back and ready to start again. I plan to do this more consistently than I used to.
10:46 AM - Video implemented.
10: 49 AM - Added some functionality to the video via command in the video tag (loop, muted and autoplay more specifically)
10:55 AM - Made the video project header appear on top of the video.
11:04 AM - Black background for video made I changed the headers color from black to white. Now I need to find a a way to center the header.
11:07 AM - I put the header in the center of the page!!!!!!
